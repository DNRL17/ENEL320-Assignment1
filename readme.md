d)
</h3>
<p>
  The demodulator for the model signal did not work for the song. To get the demodulator to <br />
  work for the song I had to implement a band pass filter.<br />
  The song is from the musical Aladin.
</p>
<h3>
e)
</h3>
<p>
  The system can take noise up to around a scale of 0.5 at which point the song can't be heard.<br />
  The measurement of the haywireness in the system is a value along a normal distribution where 50 <br />
  is the mean and 0 is the minimum.
